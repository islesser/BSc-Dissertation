# Particle Simulation

This project a GPU based particle simulation system meant to simulate the movement of particles in a grid of forces, such as wind or water. This implementation uses Perlin noise to generate the noise field with which the particles interact.

This project serves as a prototype for a BSc Computer Science Dissertation project, discarded in favor of another topic the actual implementation is complete and able to be used.

This project uses GLFW and OpenGL to handle windowing and GPU commands.

## Building & Running

This project is only currently officially supported on MacOS devices.

Run the script **./Build.sh** in your terminal, which will present a menu with the following supported inputs:

| Input | Function    | Details                                                            |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Build & Run | Generate a gmake project and then builds and runs the application. |
| 2     | Build       | Generate a gmake project and then builds the application.          |
| 3     | Clean       | Removes platform specific project files                            |
| 4     | Generate    | Generates the gmake project files                                  |
| 5     | Commit      | Will prompt for a commit message and then push to the remote repo. |

If this script will not run, you may need to run the following command in your terminal in the Particle root directory: **sudo chmod +x ./Build.sh**
